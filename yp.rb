      Thank you for installing the Year Progress Indicator (yp)! Here are some tips to get started:

      ## Configuration and Usage

      - Run `yp` in any terminal to see how much of the current year has elapsed, represented through a visually appealing progress bar.
      - Customise the appearance of your progress bar with CLI options or environment variables for a personalized touch:
        - Use CLI options like `--location` to set your timezone or `--total-blocks` to adjust the progress bar's length.
        - Alternatively, set environment variables such as `YP_LOCATION` and `YP_TOTAL_BLOCKS` for persistent configurations.

      ## Integration Ideas

      - **Terminal Welcome Message**: Enhance your terminal sessions by adding `yp` to your shell's profile (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`), so you can visualize the year's progress with every new terminal window.
      - **GitHub README**: Make your project README stand out by including the year's progress bar.
      - **Daily Logs/Journals**: Incorporate the progress bar in your digital or printed logs as a unique way to track the passage of time.
      - **Personal Websites**: Share the year's progression with visitors by integrating the tool's output into your site.

      For more details on options and configurations, run `yp --help` or check the GitHub repository: https://github.com/martinsirbe/yp

      Enjoy visualising the passage of time with yp, and feel free to contribute to its development!
